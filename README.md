The Frown Turned Upside Down:
He grins like a crack in the sky.

She walked out of rust and ruin.
Into halls that hum with lies.
Where time folds, and mirrors breathe.
And red eyes bloom behind closed lids.

The smiling man does not chase.
He does not speak.
He waits.
And when you smile, 
he steps through.

Be warned.
